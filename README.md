# RBAC
This is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) application built using Node.js, Express, and Passport.js. This app provides authentication and authorization functionality and can be used as a starting point for any project requiring user authentication.

Currently, the application supports Email and Password authentication, but it can easily be extended to support OAuth providers like Google, Facebook, Apple, GitHub, etc.

Mongoose is used as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for interacting with a MongoDB database to store user information.

Passport.js handles local email/password authentication.

The application is almost production-ready, and hereâ€™s how you can set it up:
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Madhuri243/RBAC
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the cloned repository and install all required dependencies:


cd RBAC
npm install
Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following configuration variables:


PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_URI  # Example: mongodb://localhost:27017
DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME
Replace YOUR_MONGODB_URI with your actual MongoDB connection URI and YOUR_DB_NAME with the name of your database.

Step 4: Install MongoDB (For Linux Ubuntu)
Follow the official MongoDB installation guide to install MongoDB on your machine:

MongoDB Installation Guide

Step 5: Start MongoDB Daemon
Once MongoDB is installed, start the MongoDB service with the following command:


sudo service mongod start
Step 6: Start the Application
Now, you can start the application using:


npm run dev
This will start the application on the specified PORT (default is 3000).

You now have a running Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) application that is ready for further customization or deployment!

Feel free to extend the authentication functionality by adding OAuth providers like Google, Facebook, Apple, and GitHub for user sign-in, or tailor the app to your project's needs.
